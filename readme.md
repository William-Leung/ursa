## Concept Statement
<p>Amidst the mother bear Ursa’s tireless hunt to feed her cubs, a sinister plot ripples beneath the surface. The salmon army, driven by desperation, has evolved legs and kidnapped the cubs, casting an ominous shadow on the serene snows above. Now, players must guide Ursa on a perilous journey through treacherous terrain teeming with vengeful salmon to rescue her children. </p>
<p>Fortunately, players have a couple tools at their disposal to help them brave the wilderness. Ursa’s bright white fur camouflages her with the sunlit landscape but betrays her when in shadow. Thus, as night approaches, players become more vulnerable to enemies and must seek out caves where they can rest away the night. In addition, players can push over trees to distract guards and shorten shadow lengths.</p>
